    During my time at York Tech I worked with an in class company called OnlyPogs working with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. 
    This company was based off the 90's toy pogs that came off of milk cartons, we 3d printed pogs in this class. 
    The website holds all information of the pogs in class.

    This is a simple tic tac toe game I made with a classmate.
    You're able to play against another player or an AI with 2 different difficuties.
    There's also 2 different sized boards for the game, so there's 4 different modes you can play.
