  <p>
    Most of my projects can be found on github at https://github.com/Shane24335 or https://github.com/VorpalVortex.
  </p>
  <p>
    These projects use Javascript, HTML, CSS, ThreeJS, JSON, ExpressJS, EJS, Node, C#, Python, and SQLite. 
    On the left is a project I worked on in a school company called OnlyPogs.
    This project uses SQlite3, Javascript, node, express, ejs, HTML, CSS, and JSON.
    The page I created is connected to a database and is able to sort using the tags at the top of the table. 
    Also, the text fields at the top right add items directly to the database.
  </p>
  <p>
    My other projects like artwork/graphic designs are on my VorpalVortex account. 
    Most of these are hand drawn or mouse drawn.
